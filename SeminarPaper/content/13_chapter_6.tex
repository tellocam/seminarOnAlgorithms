\section{Manual Paramter Tuning}
\textcolor{red}{
Perform some manual tuning of relevant algorithmic parameters to find sensible parameter settings
for the final experiments. Relevant parameters may be related to the degree of randomization,
neighborhood structure sizes, probabilities for the random step function in composite neighborhood
structures, the cooling schedule, the tabu list length and its variation, etc. Report the impact of a
number of different settings on the solution quality of a selected meaningful subset of instances.}

\section{Delta Evaluation}
\textcolor{red}{Use delta-evaluation.
Explain which steps in your algorithm use delta-evaluation and describe
why delta-evaluation results in better performance in this step. Are there other elements in your
algorithm that could have also benefitted from delta-evaluation?}
