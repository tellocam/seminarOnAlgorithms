\section{Results and Conclusion}

\textcolor{red}{
Run experiments and compare all your algorithms on the instances provided in TUWEL:\\
(a) deterministic and randomized construction heuristic and GRASP\\
(b) Use the solution of the deterministic construction heuristic to test the other implementations:\\
i. Local search for at least three selected (possibly composite) neighborhood structures using
each of the three step functions (i.e., at least nine different algorithm variants).\\
ii. VND\\
iii. GVNS, SA, or TS}
