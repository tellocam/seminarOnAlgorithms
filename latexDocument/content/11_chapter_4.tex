\section{Neighborhood Structures and Step Functions}

\textcolor{red}{
Develop or make use of a framework for basic local search which is able to deal with: \\
• different neighborhood structures\\
• different step functions (first-improvement, best-improvement, random)\\
5. Develop a set of meaningful neighborhood structures to address the different aspects of the problem,
i.e., related to the quality of the s-plexes, or the assignment of nodes to s-plexes.}
