            \begin{itemize}
                \item<2-> Processors could be colors while the vertices could be tasks. \\
                \item<3-> What if tasks are not equally computationally expensive? \\
                \item<4-> $\, \mapsto $ add weights $\propto$ cost and solve IVCP! \\
                \item<5-> If weights are good estimate, better performance.
                \item<6-> optimal (minimal) colorings in such an application, can lead to runtime improvement
                $\propto$ degree of parallelism. \\
                \item<7-> Unfortunately problem is NP-Complete, heuristics are required for large instances
                to get useful solutions.
